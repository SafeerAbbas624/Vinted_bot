first of all download & install python, 
then download & install pycharm

1. open main.py file in pycharm.

2. install all packages/libraries imported in code.

3. run the code when there is no red error in the pycharm top right corner. 

4. if there is red error then try to solve that error.

5. if code is running it will open vinted.fr site and login for you ID and password. 
   after that there will be verification code demand from the website.
 
6. please try to write verification code by yourself. code verification is for one time to run the code. 
   if code is running then leave it and watch for any error or mistake, 
   because bot still needs testing and developer was unable to do so because of verification.
   if any problem is there please contact Python Developer Safeer Abbas.
